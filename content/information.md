# Information for Participants

BIRS website has [several pages with information for
participants][birs-info-participants], and also a [FAQ section][birs-faq].
Here we summarized most of them into a single page. Please, checkout their
website when in doubt, or [contact us][contact].

## Accommodation

Participants' accomodation during the nights of Friday 28 and Saturday 30 are
**completely covered** by BIRS. This means that participants won't have to pay
for their room.

All participants that confirm after June 30 will have to ensure their own
accommodation, since BIRS cannot guarantee room availability.

Find more information in [BIRS Accommodations page][birs-accommodations] and in
[BIRS FAQ page on accommodation][birs-faq-accommodation].


## Meals

Meals are **not included**. Participants will have to cover the costs of their
meals. BIRS offers breakfast, lunch and dinner as buffet style at reasonable
prices.

You can check the prices and time for each meal in [BIRS Meals
page][birs-meals].


## Getting to BIRS

The easiest way to get to BIRS is from [Calgary][calgary]. There are direct
shuttles operating between Calgary International Airport and Banff Centre,
which offers a 15% discount to all BIRS participants.

Check out the details on how to make your reservation and use that discount in
[BIRS Travelling page][birs-getting-there].


## Travel grants

BIRS leads to some of its parters that can guarantee [travel grants for
participants][birs-travel-grants]. We would encourage every participant that
might need some funding aid to cover the costs of the travel to review these
travel grant options, and apply if they are eligible.

Besides that, we, the organizers, are looking for other funding options.
If you need some sort of funding aid to totally or partially cover your travel
costs, please [contact us][contact] so we can review our options.
