# Information for Participants

BIRS website has [several pages with information for
participants][birs-info-participants], and also a [FAQ section][birs-faq].
Here we summarized most of them into a single page. Please, checkout their
website when in doubt, or [contact us][contact].

## Accommodation

Participants' accomodation during the nights of Friday 28 and Saturday 29 are
**completely covered** by BIRS. This means that participants won't have to pay
for their room.

All participants that confirm after June 30 will have to ensure their own
accommodation, since BIRS cannot guarantee room availability.

Find more information in [BIRS Accommodations page][birs-accommodations] and in
[BIRS FAQ page on accommodation][birs-faq-accommodation].


## Meals

Meals are **not included**. Participants will have to cover the costs of their
meals. BIRS offers breakfast, lunch and dinner as buffet style at reasonable
prices.

You can check the prices and time for each meal in [BIRS Meals
page][birs-meals].


## Getting to BIRS

The easiest way to get to BIRS is from [Calgary][calgary]. It's possible to
drive from the Calgary International Airport to Banff, or take one of the
shuttles that operate between the Airport and Banff Centre. You can find more
directions on [how to get to BIRS in their website](birs-getting-there).

Some shuttle companies that operate between Calgary International Airport and
Banff Centre offer a [**15% discount to all BIRS
participants**](birs-shuttles).


## Travel grants

BIRS leads to some of its parters that can guarantee [travel grants for
participants][birs-travel-grants]. We would encourage every participant that
might need some funding aid to cover the costs of the travel to review these
travel grant options, and apply if they are eligible.

Besides that, we, the organizers, are looking for other funding options.
If you need some sort of funding aid to totally or partially cover your travel
costs, please [contact us][contact] so we can review our options.


## Visa letters

It's important that you check if you [need a visa to travel to
Canada][canada-visa]. You can also check out the [visa processing
time][canada-visa-times], which could vary depending on where you are applying
from.

If you do need a visa, BIRS can send you a visa letter that you
can attach to your application. Read more about it in their [FAQ
Section][birs-faq].


## Recreation

Besides the formal activities of the workshop, participants are encouraged to
enjoy their time in Banff and use the Banff Centre facilites. They include an
athletic complex with swimming pool, running track, workout room, climbing wall
and more. It also has nice arts and music library.
Besides, there are a lot of trails around Banff that participants could visit
and hike.
