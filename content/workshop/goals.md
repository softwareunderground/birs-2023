## Goals

The main goal of this 2-day workshop is to gather the communities of
[SimPEG][simpeg] and [Fatiando a Terra][fatiando] to work on the following
topics:

### Fully open-source geophysical workflows

What are the missing pieces for developing an complete **open-source
geophysical workflow**? Having open-source tools that can go from **processing
raw data** to producing **interpretable models** would be a major asset for the
broader geoscientific community, including academia and industry practitioners.
During this workshop we will overview the available tools that the two projects
currently offer and design a roadmap for developing the missing pieces.

### Interoperability and usability of our tools

We will work on increasing the interoperability of [SimPEG][simpeg] and
[Fatiando][fatiando], identifying overlapping points and goals, and produce
a plan for the joint development of common tools that both project can
leverage.
Enhancing the usability of our tools is also a major goal: we will discuss ways
to improve their documentation, providing new examples, references and
tutorials.

### Community building, diversity and sustainability

We acknowledge the lack of diversity within our communities and we'd like to
overcome it.
We will take this opportunity to discuss strategies on how to make the two
projects grow, while increasing the diversity of the projects' communities by
considering initiatives like mentorship programs for underrepresented
minorities and connecting with mission-driven organizations.
We will also discuss ways to ensure the sustainability of the two projects in
the long-term, how to nurture participation of users and train the next
generation of developers and contributors.
