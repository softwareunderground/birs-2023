## Description

The [Banff International Research Station][birs] will host the _"Open-Source
Tools to Enable Geophysical Data Processing and Inversion"_ workshop in Banff
from July 28 to July 30, 2023.

Solving Earth science challenges like environmental remediation, carbon capture
and storage, geothermal energy, critical mineral exploration, and groundwater
assessment require top-notch mathematical and computational solutions that
enable us to process geophysical data and build models of the subsurface that
are in agreement with these data. The development of software tools that are
freely available and easy to use accelerates research by enabling students,
researchers, and industry professionals to apply them to solve relevant
problems involving securing safe drinking water, providing renewable energy,
and exploring critical minerals for a low carbon future.

[Fatiando a Terra][fatiando] and [SimPEG][simpeg]
are two projects that provide open-source Python tools for processing and
inverting geophysical data through a community-driven model of development.
During this workshop, the two communities that develop and maintain these
projects will join together to share the latest advances in their research and
software packages. We will plan and design tools for solving common problems,
explore new research avenues, design the software pieces needed to accelerate
them, and nurture the growth of the two communities while increasing their
diversity and fostering the active participation of early-career researchers.
