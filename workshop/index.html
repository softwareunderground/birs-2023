<p>The <a href="https://www.birs.ca">Banff International Research Station</a> will host the <em>&quot;Open-Source
Tools to Enable Geophysical Data Processing and Inversion&quot;</em> workshop in Banff
from July 28 to July 30, 2023.</p>
<p>Solving Earth science challenges like environmental remediation, carbon capture
and storage, geothermal energy, critical mineral exploration, and groundwater
assessment require top-notch mathematical and computational solutions that
enable us to process geophysical data and build models of the subsurface that
are in agreement with these data. The development of software tools that are
freely available and easy to use accelerates research by enabling students,
researchers, and industry professionals to apply them to solve relevant
problems involving securing safe drinking water, providing renewable energy,
and exploring critical minerals for a low carbon future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fatiando.org">Fatiando a Terra</a> and <a href="https://simpeg.xyz">SimPEG</a>
are two projects that provide open-source Python tools for processing and
inverting geophysical data through a community-driven model of development.
During this workshop, the two communities that develop and maintain these
projects will join together to share the latest advances in their research and
software packages. We will plan and design tools for solving common problems,
explore new research avenues, design the software pieces needed to accelerate
them, and nurture the growth of the two communities while increasing their
diversity and fostering the active participation of early-career researchers.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals<a class="zola-anchor" href="#goals" aria-label="Anchor link for: goals">üîó</a></h2>
<p>The main goal of this 2-day workshop is to gather the communities of
<a href="https://simpeg.xyz">SimPEG</a> and <a href="https://www.fatiando.org">Fatiando a Terra</a> to work on the following
topics:</p>
<h3 id="fully-open-source-geophysical-workflows">Fully open-source geophysical workflows<a class="zola-anchor" href="#fully-open-source-geophysical-workflows" aria-label="Anchor link for: fully-open-source-geophysical-workflows">üîó</a></h3>
<p>What are the missing pieces for developing an complete <strong>open-source
geophysical workflow</strong>? Having open-source tools that can go from <strong>processing
raw data</strong> to producing <strong>interpretable models</strong> would be a major asset for the
broader geoscientific community, including academia and industry practitioners.
During this workshop we will overview the available tools that the two projects
currently offer and design a roadmap for developing the missing pieces.</p>
<h3 id="interoperability-and-usability-of-our-tools">Interoperability and usability of our tools<a class="zola-anchor" href="#interoperability-and-usability-of-our-tools" aria-label="Anchor link for: interoperability-and-usability-of-our-tools">üîó</a></h3>
<p>We will work on increasing the interoperability of <a href="https://simpeg.xyz">SimPEG</a> and
<a href="https://www.fatiando.org">Fatiando</a>, identifying overlapping points and goals, and produce
a plan for the joint development of common tools that both project can
leverage.
Enhancing the usability of our tools is also a major goal: we will discuss ways
to improve their documentation, providing new examples, references and
tutorials.</p>
<h3 id="community-building-diversity-and-sustainability">Community building, diversity and sustainability<a class="zola-anchor" href="#community-building-diversity-and-sustainability" aria-label="Anchor link for: community-building-diversity-and-sustainability">üîó</a></h3>
<p>We acknowledge the lack of diversity within our communities and we'd like to
overcome it.
We will take this opportunity to discuss strategies on how to make the two
projects grow, while increasing the diversity of the projects' communities by
considering initiatives like mentorship programs for underrepresented
minorities and connecting with mission-driven organizations.
We will also discuss ways to ensure the sustainability of the two projects in
the long-term, how to nurture participation of users and train the next
generation of developers and contributors.</p>
