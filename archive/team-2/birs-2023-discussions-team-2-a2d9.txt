*BIRS 2023: Team 2
Team members:
    - Santi
    - Anran
    - Parth
    - India
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions:
	* Etherpad is a nice collaboration tool that allows us to create shared documents where everyone can write.
	* Content will be highlighted with a specific color for each collaborator.
	* We encourage you to add your name through the top right button (the one with the people logo), so we can keep track of your inputs.
	* Etherpad offers the option to remove the highlight after text has been added. Please don't do it.
	* Start writing and don't delete other people's inputs.
	* You can add comments to other people's inputs: select the text and use the comment button in the top bar.
	* Please, don't share the link to the pad.

*Discussion Questions

*How can we improve the communication within our communities?
	* How do you mainly interact with the SimPEG and Fatiando communities? (Slack channels, forums, weekly meetings, etc.) 
	* What aspects do you like and don't like about them? 
	* What could be improved? 
	* Are our communication channels working for the community? How they can be improved?
	* Are there any alternative channels we should explore? 

Documentation

We identified that documentation is another form of communication within our projects. In this sense, we identified some places for improvements on the documentation pages of our projects.

	* Discoverability of communication channels. Better advertise the Slack Channels, SimPEG newsletter, 
	* Getting started guides for newcomers
		* Generate comprehensive getting started pages with guides to how to get involved in the community, how to start using the software, how to contribute.
		* Include links to:
			* Meeting calendar
			* Youtube video
			* Meeting notes
			* Communication channels (Slack, forums, etc)
	* FAQs section in documentation pages
		* Write down complete answers to frequently asked questions that we can point people to when they ask them.
	* Have a page that lists all existing tutorials (like gallery examples but for tutorials)
		* Link the tutorials in the relevant documentation
		* Link useful learning materials/books like Geosci.xyz for physics and math background
	* Include source code into the documentation page for a function or class
		* See how we do it in Fatiando and implement it in SimPEG
	* Add a page that lists published work that use SimPEG and/or Fatiando 
		* It is useful to see examples of how people are using the packages in research and this would capture emerging application not captured by the gallery or tutorials.

Meetings

	* Monthly recap meeting, and upload to YouTube channel
		* The monthly recap meeting should conclude the new updates for the past month so that new contributors can catch up with them.
	* Having two time slots for meetings
		* They allow people from different regions of the world to connect


*What future research can be enabled by SimPEG and Fatiando?
	* What future research directions and use cases are you considering to take in which SimPEG and Fatiando could be useful?
	* How SimPEG and/or Fatiando can enable them?
	* What parts of these research directions do you think are possible to achieve at the moment with the existing tools?
	* What parts aren't?
	* What do you think it's needed to achieve them? 

New features
	* Enable adjusting p value (Lp-norm) in data misfit term
	* Pre-processing data corrections for potential field to take raw data from the instrument
		* Adding drift, base stations, levelling, tide, latitude,etc. corrections.

Making our codes faster
	* CUDA implementation: Run matrix operation on GPU will be faster than on CPU since GPU is good at parallel computing
	* To accelerate running them on CPUs, we may consider use openMP, which enables then to run on multi-core CPUs. Or Devito (https://github.com/devitocodes/devito) that is used by SLIM group at Georgia Tech (https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl)

Working together (make Fatiando and SimPEG work more tightly together)
	* Joint meetings to prevent overlap and work together on common points
	* Work together on using Choclo and Geoana for forward modelling operations
	* Start putting together tutorials
		* Create tutorials that take raw data to inversion using both packages
		* Organise an event like Transform using the tutorials
		* Work on these tutorials piece by piece, start publishing them online
		* 

Theoretical background references
	* Expand geosci.xyz or work on the Geophysics Library that Leo started
	* Useful for students and for professional from other fields
	* Include all the theoretical background math and concepts needed to use the packages. Keep the same notation and define a glossary.
	* Connect functions and tutorials with these theoretical background pages.
		* E.g: a forward function for gravity should connect with the pages for gravitational forces


*How can we increase the diversity of our communities?
	* How to create a more welcoming environment for people to interact with our  communities?
	* Should we create connections with other organizations that push towards more diversity in science?
	* Which organizations?
	* How that interaction would look like? What activities could we jointly do? 

Barriers for underrepresented groups to engage with our communities
	* Language
		* Add tutorials or video walk-through in home-languages of devs and practitioners.
		* Some note: It's challenging to translate docstrings, and hard to maintain.
	* Lack of entry level contributors and users in meetings and Slack
		* Seeing not only experience users and developers in the meetings would encourage other newcomers to interact more and join more meetings

Connecting with other organizations
Present our works to workshops hold by organizations that encourage diversity
		* Possible organizations to reach out to: 
			* Earth Science Women's Network (https://eswnonline.org/)
			* diversity sub-committees in AGU, EGU,etc; 
			* Women in mining  (https://wimcanada.org/)
			* GeoLatinas (https://geolatinas.org/nosotras/)
			* Equator project (https://equatorresearchgroup.wordpress.com/);
			* Software Sustainability Institute (https://www.software.ac.uk/)

Mentorship program
	* Pair newcomers to mentors
		* Easier to ask questions for a newcomer to one person rather than the whole dev community. 
	* Give priority to newcomers in the underrepresented groups 
	* Match mentee and mentor with similar cultural background
	* If newcomers struggle with the software background, they can start with helping with the theoretical background pages
	* Tutorials/guide for newcomers will help assist mentoring

*How to make these projects more sustainable?
	* How sustainable do you perceive these projects are?
		* "They will last for decades" vs "I see they could stop being maintained at any point"
	* How to ensure future development, maintenance and community support of the  projects?
	* How can we assess the impact of these projects in the geoscientific community?
	* How can we encourage users and researchers to share works that use SimPEG  and Fatiando?

Metrics
	* Citations
	* Downloads
	* Mira/geoapps
	* Should add analytics in SimPEG documentation (like Fatiando) to track where users are coming from and which pages are visited most. 

Sponsors
	* Spread the word through conferences and workshops
	* Call for donation after presenting the works using SimPEG and Fatiando

Tutorials and theoretical background pages
	* Helps newcomers to start getting involved
	* Can be used for teaching, conferences, workshops, events, etc.
